- 👋 Hi, I’m @gatzcat
- 👀 I’m still a junior programmer, looking for my niche in this world (leaning towards fullstack). 
- 🙏 I'll happily accept tips on how to improve my chances of breaking into the tech industry.
- 🌱 I’m currently completing a part-time Frontend dev course with Codeop to improve on my Javascript skills. I completed [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/) in 2021.
- 💞️ I’m still exploring what it is I really enjoy in the world of programming. 
- 📫 You can reach me via [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/limadeline3/). You'll see I'm a great diversity hire! 🌈

For my CS50 final project, I created a web app called Seizure Superstar related to epilepsy, which you can see in my demo in the [following video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZsmZ-JI3xU). You can check out my repo [here](https://github.com/gatzcat/finalproject).
