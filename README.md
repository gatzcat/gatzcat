- 👋 Hi, I’m @gatzcat
- 👀 I’m interested in casual programming, videogames, and pet grooming
- 🌱 I’m currently completing a part time Frontend dev course with Codeop. Previously I have completed [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/).
- 💞️ I’m still exploring what it is I really enjoy in the world of programming.

For my CS50 final project, I created a web app called Seizure Superstar related to epilepsy, which you can see in my demo in the [following video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZsmZ-JI3xU). You can check out my repo [here](https://github.com/gatzcat/finalproject).
